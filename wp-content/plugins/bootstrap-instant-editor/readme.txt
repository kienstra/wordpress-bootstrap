See your full front page as you edit, with instant updates. Select any image, resize it, and enter text. 

== Description ==

Using Bootstrap, this generates a jumbotron and a row of 2, 3, or 4 columns. They're automatically added to your front page, but you can change the placement with shortcode.

See a [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOXRZ0eYSA0 "video demo")

You'll get instant feedback, but it won't be published until you click "Save Changes."

All images and text will be centered, and images can be resized.

In the "Appearance" menu, click "Customize." You'll see "Top Jumbotron" and "Panels" listed on the left. Edit them, and watch your front page update.

Requires Bootstrap 3. If you don't have it, indicate this on the plugin settings page. It will be added your front page. This will change your style completely, though.

Your "Reading Settings" must have "Front Page Displays" set to "Static Page."

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if I don't have Bootstrap? =
This plugin probably won't work, unless you have no stylesheets. Go to the settings page and indicate that you don't have Bootstrap. A stylesheet will be added for you.

= Can I keep my own front page content? =
Yes, go to this plugin's settings page and select "shortcodes." But this plugin generates a jumbotron and a row, which look best at top of the page. It won't interfere with your top navbar, though. If you would like more settings, please contact me.

= Does this work with .svg images? =
No, but I would like to add support for them.

== Screenshots ==

1. Edit your page in the left panel, while seeing instant feedback. Your live site won't update until you hit "Save and Publish."
2. Change the settings to show 2, 3, or 4 columns. Use shortcodes only if you prefer.
3. The "Image Size" tool helps when there are 3 or 4 columns.
