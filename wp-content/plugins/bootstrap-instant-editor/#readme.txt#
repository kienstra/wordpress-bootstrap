See your full front page as you edit, with instant updates. Select any image, resize it, and enter text. 

== Description ==

Using Bootstrap, this generates a jumbotron and a row of 2, 3, or 4 columns. They're automatically added to your front page, but you can change the placement with shortcode.

You'll get instant feedback, but it won't be published until you click "Save Changes."

All images and text will be centered, and images can be resized.

Click "Customize Your Site," and find the "Top Jumbotron" and "Panels" listed on the left. Edit them, and watch your front page update.

Requires Bootstrap 3. If you don't have it, indicate this on the plugin settings page. It will be added your front page. This will change your style completely, though.

Your "Reading Settings" must have "Front Page Displays" set to "Static Page."

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this work if I don't have Bootstrap 3? =
Yes, but it'll completely change the rest of your front page. Go to the settings page and indicate that you don't have Bootstrap. A stylesheet will be added for you.

= What items does this add to the front page? =
This will add a jumbotron and a row of columns. Each will have an image, a heading, and body copy. You may leave out text, and you may resize the image with the slider.

= Can I keep my own front page content? =
Yes, go to this plugin's settings page and select "shortcodes." But this plugin generates a jumbotron and a row, which look best at top of the page. It won't interfere with your top navbar, though. If you would like more settings, please contact me.

= Does this work with .svg images? =
No, but I would like to add support for them.
