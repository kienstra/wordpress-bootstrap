Swipe through your gallery. Fast page load for mobile devices.

== Description ==

* Must have Twitter Bootstrap 3 with Glyphicons. 
* Click on a gallery image and swipe through the pop-up.
* Demo: www.ryankienstra.com/swipe-gallery
* Images re-size for mobile devices.
* Light: Only sends 3 small files to the browser. Does nothing if there's no gallery.
* Works with themes "Bootstrap Ultimate," "DevDmBootstrap3," "evolve," "Unite." 
* Doesn't work with "Customizr," "Inkzine," and "Radiant."
* Doesn't change the gallery on your page. Only creates a pop-up when you click. 
* Don't download if you need to be sure this works. This plugin keeps your page load fast by using your Glyphicons. You'll see if it works when you activate it and click on a gallery image, though.
